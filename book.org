We hope this manuscript contains all the basic things you need to know to get started writing a book using Leanpub-Flavored Markdown.

If you switch to writing in the Markua syntax instead of Leanpub-Flavored Markdown, please be sure to rename the =images= folder in your =manuscript= folder to =resources.=

If there is anything simple that you think we should add, please email us at [[mailto:hello@leanpub.com][hello@leanpub.com]].

We recommend you take a few minutes to explore all the options in the Book Tools menu for your book on Leanpub. We've built a lot of powerful features that can help you write and sell your book!

That figure from Chapter 2 is [[#marm-ang-tangie][here]].
